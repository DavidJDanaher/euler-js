# euler-js
Exercises from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about">Project Euler</a> completed in Javascript.

Requires <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.  To run, enter `node solve <problem number>` on the command line from the directory. 

I am interested in learning more about algorithms, and I would be glad for constructive feedback.
